The main task of this assignment is to analyse some RNAseq data that has been generated from a Trypanosoma congolense RNAi experiment in the IL3000 laboratory strain of T.congolense that knocks down a specific gene. As the gene encodes an enzyme that is critical for energy metabolism, the hypothesis is that loss of function of this enzyme might illuminate other pathways that he parasite might activate to circumvent loss of the default pathway.
